# 1. Type Katakana

By default, you can type Hiragana on windows after installing IME. If you want to switch to Kitakana, type `Alt` + `CapsLock`. Then you can type `Ctrl` + `CapsLock` to switch to Hiragana.

# 2. Katakana

Katakana has the same syllabary from [[1. あいうえお|Hiragana]], but Kitakana is more angular.

1. Katakana is always used to spell out foreign words using Japanese syllabary. Most country names, foreign names and all long words from the modern era are written in Katakana.
2. Katakana is also used to write down onomia sounds like how you would see sound effects written in Japanese manga.
3. Katakana is also used for emphasis, such as "それは==ダメ==！" means "don't do that!"

# 4. のばしぼう

In hiragana, we use double character to indicate a long vowel sounds, just like "ああ".

In Katakana, a long vowel is indicated by the のばしぼう：ー, such as "アー！"

- ア！：expression when realizing something suddenly.
- イー！：expression showing annoyance.
- ウー．．．：expression showing dislike or bad feelings.
- エ！：expression showing surprise
- オー！：expression showing amazement, admiration
- エア：air
- イエイ！：Yay!
- エーアイ：AI

# 5. digraphs

In order to accommodate more sounds available from foreign words, Katakana uses the small version of the characters to make digraphs outside of those used in Japanese：

- イェ、ウィ、ウェ、ウォ
- ヴァ、ヴィ、ヴェ、ヴォ

Because ヴ always be pronounced "bi", ヴァ、ヴィ、ヴェ、ヴォ can be spelled as バ、ビ、ベ、ボ
